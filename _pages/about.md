I'm Braeden Alford, a new data scientist with a background in mathematics. I'm super passionate about bringing the world of maths, data, and visualisations together to create a valuable construct that can appeal to a broad audience. 

Primarily utilising Python and R, I have been able to dive into all aspects of data science with a specific focus on the analytics, visualisations, and machine learning techniques as these feel quite natural given my undergraduate. 

Outside of the data science realm, I have an avid interest in sports, and love to go into depth with the wealth of data and statistics available, so you will definitely see and be seeing all kinds of projects and visualisations based on a range of these sports.
